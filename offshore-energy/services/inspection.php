                                    Phased array inspection is an advanced technique that uses ultrasonic rays. It is
                                    relatively non-intrusive and usually requires minimal dismantling for access. It is
                                    an ideal method when you need a fast technique that minimises down-time.<br /><br />
                                    All NDT can be carried out via rope work and it can be a cost-effective alternative
                                    to stripping down a full piece of equipment.<br /><br />

                            <p>EMAG inspection provides more confidence because:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The technique allows us to 'see' inside the rope, to detect broken wires and
                                    corrosion wherever it occurs.</li>
                                <li>The technique provides quantitative data as opposed to a subjective visual
                                    inspection.</li>
                                <li>Wire ropes being tested do not have to be cleaned first, minimising time.</li>
                                <li>We test the ropes and evaluate the results in accordance with standards accepted
                                    throughout the world.</li>
                                <li>We are able to provide instantaneous results by connecting with a computer while
                                    testing is taking place.</li>
                                <li>For breaks on the surface, the sensor head will find one broken wire in as many as
                                    250 wires.</li>
                                <li>For internal breaks, the detector will find fractures when they amount to 1% or more
                                    of the total number of wires.</li>
                                <li>For corrosion at any location, the sensor will find 1% or more loss in cross
                                    sectional area.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We carry out the inspections on your asset and spool the rope using a tensioner and
                                sheave skid system. By using the tensioner we can ensure the rope is re-spooled at the
                                required tension ensuring consistent and accurate line tension is maintained during the
                                process. Data logging of the re-spooling tension provides evidence that the ropes have
                                been re-spooled onto the crane winch drum at the required percentage of rope minimum
                                braking load (MBL).</p>
                            <p>The system is cost effective and time efficient as the ropes do not have to be fully
                                unspooled and transported to an onshore location.</p>
                            <p>Our inspectors are certified ASNT Level II in Magnetic Flux Leakage as well as qualified
                                visual inspectors for wire ropes and slings.</p>
